Central configuration for the Industrial Intelligence Agent.

Everything that differs between a laptop, CI and a cloud deployment lives
here and is read from the environment. No secret is ever hardcoded or
given a working default — the defaults below are non-secret shapes
(paths, model names, region) only.

Phase 2 read DATABASE_URL directly from os.environ in its scripts. From
Phase 3 onwards the number of knobs grows (vector store, embedding model,
Vertex project), so they are collected in one place rather than scattered
across modules.

    #     request acts as is derived from the key, so a caller can only
    #     ever reach their own tenant's rows and documents.
    #   * AUTH_REQUIRED=true  -> every tenant-scoped endpoint needs a valid
    #     X-API-Key; no key or a wrong key is a 401.
    #   * AUTH_REQUIRED unset -> the zero-config demo posture: a request
    #     with no key acts as the demo tenant ("default"); a request that
    #     sends a key must still send a valid one. Defaults to true
    #     whenever the legacy API_KEY below is set, so setting it keeps
    #     enforcing auth exactly as it did before.
    #   * Phase 1 security default: when AUTH_REQUIRED is unset AND
    #     DATABASE_URL points at a non-local host (see database_is_remote),
    #     auth is required too. A deployment pointed at a real database no
    #     longer serves unauthenticated demo traffic by default; running
    #     with AUTH_REQUIRED=false there is still possible but is explicit
    #     and logged as a warning at startup.
    #   * API_KEY (legacy, optional) is a bootstrap credential for the demo
    #     tenant only — handy for a single-tenant deployment that hasn't
    #     created a `tenants` row key yet. It can never select another

    # earnings" and MAN-200's maintenance-interval table). No single
    # absolute number separated those two cases correctly.

    # own eval set (app/rag/evaluation.py RELEVANCE_CASES) plus the
    # shorter/filtered queries used in tests/test_rag.py:
    #   - the lowest coverage any required hit needs is 0.33 (a
    #     failure_mode-filtered query matching 1 of its 3 terms)

    #     tax deadlines, tutorials, sports, movies...) tops out at 0.25
    #     coverage, from single coincidental term matches
    # 0.3 sits in that gap. It is not perfect: a query can still coincide
    # with a *real* use of a shared word in an unrelated maintenance
    # record (e.g. "M-17 quarterly earnings" still matches an incident
    # report's genuine "quarterly-check limit" phrase at 0.5 coverage) —

    # retrieval, not something a coverage threshold can fix, and is
