"""FastAPI application entrypoint — Phase 6.

The Engine is created once here, in the lifespan, and stored on
`app.state.db_engine` — not at import time (importing app.main shouldn't
require DATABASE_URL, e.g. for tooling that only needs the OpenAPI schema)
and not per-request (that would defeat connection pooling). It is disposed
on shutdown so the process doesn't leak connections if reloaded in-process
by a test runner.

The retriever is deliberately NOT built here. `get_retriever()` is already
lazy and process-wide-cached (app/rag/retriever.py); building it eagerly on
every app startup would pay its cost (BM25 indexing, or a Pinecone
describe_index round trip) even for requests that never touch it, which in
Phase 4 is every request — /investigate and /chat are stubs.

Run with: uvicorn app.main:app --reload
