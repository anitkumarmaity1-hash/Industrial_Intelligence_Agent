"""Tenant context for Postgres row-level security (Phase 2).

RLS policies compare each row's tenant_id with the transaction-local setting
`app.tenant_id`. This module is the single place that sets it:

  * `install(engine)` registers a `begin` listener. Every time a transaction
    starts on a Connection that was bound to a tenant, the setting is
    (re)applied with `set_config(..., true)` and a bound parameter. A commit
    in the middle of a request (routes._audit) therefore costs nothing: the
    next statement opens a new transaction and the listener re-applies it.
  * `bind_tenant(conn, tenant_id)` records the tenant on that Connection
    object only (an execution option), never on the pooled DBAPI connection,
    and applies it at once if a transaction is already open.

The setting is transaction-local, so it vanishes at commit/rollback; a pooled
connection can never carry a previous request's tenant. No context set means
`current_setting` is NULL/'' and the policies match no rows (fail closed).
